            <h2>photography</h2> <br>
                <p>Photography was a hobby I picked up as <br>
soon I was gifted a point-and-shoot when <br>
I was in second grade. As a heavy sentimentalist, <br>
I was fascinated how a camera allowed me to <br>
document these memories wherever I go. <br>
<br>
I grew to love the art of creating new perspectives <br>
of everyday’s subjects and motions. I also love <br>
being a part of people’s special moments, and <br>
giving them something to remember them by. I now <br>
do shoots for weddings, portraits, and lifestyle.  </p>

            <h2>music</h2> <br>
                <p>Music is a shared passion within my family. <br>
I grew up playing the piano, and loving whatever <br>
classical or rock music my dad would listen to. As someone that<br>
Is often at a “loss for words”, I find music both an interesting and <br>
beautiful form of communication.<br>
I picked up the guitar and ukulele later, and I enjoy plaguing <br>
my house with my singing. I love listening to music, <br>
and I enjoy jamming with my brother often.</p>

            <h2>travel</h2> <br>
                I have a lot of family outside of the country, so my family travelled often. <br>
While we were away, we would explore neighboring destinations where <br>
I developed my love for immersing myself in cultures different than mine,  <br>
understanding new lifestyles, and meeting new people.
